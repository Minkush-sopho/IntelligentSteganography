# IntelligentSteganography
Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.The advantage of steganography over cryptography alone is that the intended secret message does not attract attention to itself as an object of scrutiny. Plainly visible encrypted messages, no matter how unbreakable they are, arouse interest and may in themselves be incriminating in countries in which encryption is illegal.
Here in this code it is done on an image and can be extended for videos and other files also.

# Why Intelligent ?
It is Intelligent because in this the message is hidden intelligently in a way that it finds specific areas in the image where, on changing the bits, there should be minimum perceptible noise thus making it hard to detect any change by physically observing the image.Also to make the noise less only the least significant bit of every color of the pixel has been changed.

# Dependencies 
OpenCv, Numpy and Matplotlib
